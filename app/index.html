          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Sqreen respects your privacy and takes significant efforts to protect all your data.</p>
          <p>We are <a href="/company.html">product security nerds</a>. Transparency and responsiveness are part of our key values. We care about developers protection, and we are developers ourselves. Making products safer can't be achieved without the
            community!</p>
          <p>Sqreen supports responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. We encourage all of you to report security issues to security@sqreen.io.</p>

        <div id="best_practices" class="sc-block">
          <h2>Best Practices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>All of our services run in the cloud. Sqreen does not host or run its own routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers.</li>
            <li>Our services and data are hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilities in Europe (other zones are available on Enterprise plans on request). Sqreen services have been built with resilience and principle of least privilege in mind.</li>
            <li>Our servers are within our own virtual private cloud (VPC) with network access control lists (ACLâ€™s) and no public IP addresses that prevent unauthorized requests getting to our internal network.</li>
